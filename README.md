[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lotgd/module-project.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lotgd/module-race)

This module allows a simple selection of races for characters upon a new day.

Currently, it does not provide any hooks for future race modules.

Currently, the following races are available:
- Human
- Elf
- Dwarf

A more easily customizable selection is planned for the future with hooks and submodules is planned for the future.
